## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a basic implementation for pulling Transaction History and current RAILGUNB balances from the RAILGUN Relays. 


üçª A full transaction history will be saved locally for double checking your balances and transactions. 

‚õîÔ∏è No transactions will be made!

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
NodeJS
npm (or) yarn
```

### Installing

Some basic instructions on how to get the project operational.

##### Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zy0n/railgun-cli
```
##### Enter the Repo
```sh
cd railgun-cli
```
##### Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Okay so its relatively simple. You only need your mnemonic.
#####Usage Flags:
```sh

 --mnemonic 'YOUR_MNEMONIC_PHRASE' # Mnemonic Must be quoted.
 --pass SECRET_PASSWORD
 --chain ethereum #OPTIONALPARAM| 
 # Default: ethereum    - Choices: [ethereum, polygon] 

```
Example Usage:
**Do NOT load funds into the example mnemonic. This was pulled from the RAILGUN mocks. It's a good example to use here, as it has available transaction history on polygon to view.**

*Be sure make sure you're in the main directory.*
#####yarn
```sh
yarn start --mnemonic 'pause crystal tornado alcohol genre cement fade large song like bag where' --pass SomethingSecret --chain polygon
```

#####node
```sh
node src/railgun-cli.js --mnemonic 'pause crystal tornado alcohol genre cement fade large song like bag where' --pass SomethingSecret --chain polygon
```


## Todo: <a name = "todo"></a>
- [ ] Get the binaries to build properly.
- [ ] Add support for the rest of the available chains.
- [ ] Add support for loading existing stored wallets.
- [ ] Add support for handling transactions ? 
[ üé± ] Suggestions??

######As of right now building with PKG is failing to produce a running executable. Which in reality, i didnt want to provide executables anyway, but its nice for you to build them still!
